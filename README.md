Deep Learning and Data Augmentation for Detecting Self-Admitted Technical Debt

Abstract:
Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) refers to circumstances where developers use code comments, issues, pull requests, or other textual artifacts to explain why the existing implementation is not optimal. Past research in detecting SATD has focused on either identifying SATD (classifying an artifact as SATD or not) or categorizing SATD (labeling artifacts as SATD that pertain to requirements, design, code, test, etc.) However, the performance of such approaches remains suboptimal, particularly when dealing with specific types of SATD such as test and requirement debt. This is mostly because the used datasets are extremely imbalanced.

In this study, we utilize a data augmentation strategy to address the problem of imbalanced data. We also employ a two-step approach to identify and categorize SATD on a variety of datasets derived from different artifacts. Based on earlier research, a deep learning architecture called BiLSTM is utilized for the binary identification of SATD. The BERT architecture is then utilized to categorize different types of SATD. We provide the dataset of balanced classes as a contribution for future TD researchers, and we also show that the performance of SATD identification and categorization using deep learning and our two-step approach is significantly better than baseline deep learning approaches.

This dataset has undergone a data augmentation process using the AugGPT technique. Meanwhile, the original dataset can be downloaded via the following link: https://github.com/yikun-li/satd-different-sources-data
